## 🎯 **Choose Your Deployment Method**

### **METHOD 1: Railway Dashboard (Easiest - No CLI)**

#### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "FL server ready"
git branch -M main

# Create repo at github.com/new first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### **Step 2: Deploy**
1. Visit: https://railway.app/new
2. Click **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Select your repository
4. Railway detects `Dockerfile` automatically
5. Click **"Deploy"**

#### **Step 3: Configure**
In Railway → **Variables** tab, add:
```
FL_CONFIG    = configs/mnist_config.py
NUM_ROUNDS   = 5
ALPHA        = 0.5
MIN_CLIENTS  = 2
```

Click **"Deploy"** to restart with new variables.

#### **Step 4: Get TCP Address**
Railway dashboard shows:
```
Service URL: tcp://containers.railway.app:xxxxx
```
Copy this address!

---

### **METHOD 2: Railway CLI (Automated)**

#### **Install CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

#### **Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1
```

#### **Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

The script does everything automatically!

#### **Get TCP Address:**
```bash
railway status
```

## 👥 **Connect Clients**

Once server is deployed, run clients locally:

### **Windows:**
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python client_generic.py `
    --config configs/mnist_config.py `
    --server-address containers.railway.app:xxxxx `
    --client-id 0
```

### **Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python client_generic.py \
    --config configs/mnist_config.py \
    --server-address containers.railway.app:xxxxx \
    --client-id 0
```

Run on **2+ computers** with different `--client-id` values!

---

## 🔍 **Monitor Deployment**

### **View Logs:**
- **Dashboard**: Railway → "Deployments" → "View Logs"
- **CLI**: `railway logs`

### **Expected Output:**
```
🌐 GENERIC FEDERATED LEARNING SERVER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Configuration:
   • Model config: configs/mnist_config.py
   • Model class: Net
   • Server address: 0.0.0.0:8080
   • Rounds: 5
   • Alpha (blending): 0.5
   • Minimum clients: 2
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⏳ Waiting for at least 2 clients to connect...
```

When clients connect:
```
✅ 2 clients connected! Starting federated learning...

============================================================
📊 Round 1 - Received 2 client(s), 0 failure(s)
   Client 0: 30000 training samples
   Client 1: 30000 training samples
============================================================

🔀 Round 1 - Blending models:
   Server weight: 50.0%
   Clients (averaged) weight: 50.0%

💾 Saved model to './models/Net_round_1.pth'
```

## 🚀 **Deploy Multiple Models**

Want to run MNIST and CIFAR-10 simultaneously?

### **Create Second Service:**

1. Railway dashboard → **"New"** → **"GitHub Repo"**
2. Select **same repository**
3. Name it `fl-cifar`
4. Set **different variables**:
   ```
   FL_CONFIG = configs/cifar10_config.py
   ```

### **Result:**
```
Service 1: fl-mnist  → tcp://containers.abc.railway.app:11111
Service 2: fl-cifar  → tcp://containers.xyz.railway.app:22222
```

Each service runs independently with its own model!

## 💰 **Costs**

### **Railway Free Tier:**
- ✅ $5 credit/month
- ✅ ~500 hours runtime
- ✅ Perfect for testing

### **Production (paid):**
- ~$0.01/hour for basic container
- ~$7/month for 24/7 uptime
- ~$10-20/month for production workload

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Build failed"**
- Check `requirements.txt` is valid
- Verify `Dockerfile` syntax
- View build logs in Railway dashboard

### **"Can't connect from client"**
- Use **TCP** address (not HTTPS)
- Check `MIN_CLIENTS` setting
- Verify client uses matching config

### **"Waiting for clients forever"**
- Make sure you run at least `MIN_CLIENTS` clients
- Check firewall allows outbound TCP
- Verify server address is correct

### **"Module not found"**
- Ensure all dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Check Railway build logs
- Redeploy if needed
